# Autocomplete Component in React TypeScript

## Overview

This project implements an auto-complete component in React TypeScript. The auto-complete component is designed to provide a seamless user experience with efficient performance and proper TypeScript typings. It follows strict guidelines to meet production-ready standards and adheres to specific requirements outlined below.

## Project requirements

- No 3rd Party Libraries: Pure React and internal DOM functions are used for implementation. No external dependencies are allowed.
- TypeScript: Proper interfaces and types are defined to ensure type safety and maintainability.
- Asynchronous Data Filtering: The function to filter the data is asynchronous, simulating a real REST call. Mock data (e.g., JSON array) is used for demonstration.
- Text Highlighting: Matching parts of the text are highlighted to improve readability and user interaction.
- No External State Management Libraries: Native React methods are used for state management, without relying on external libraries.
- Functional Components with Hooks: Only functional components with hooks are used throughout the project for modern and efficient React development.
